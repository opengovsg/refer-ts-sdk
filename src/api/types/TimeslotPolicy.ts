/**
 * How timeslots are handled for this offering. Is enforced at validation.
 * timeslot-required: Timeslots must be selected when creating a referral.
 * optional-timeslots-and-urgentable: Timeslots are selectable but optional. If no timeslot is selected, the referral will be routed to a manual call-centre for scheduling. If you indicate `isUrgent: true`, the timeslot will be disregarded and referral will be sent to the call-centre for triage.
 * no-timeslots: Timeslots are not selectable for this offering. Calling the timeslot API will return an error.
